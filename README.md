# BulletDroid
Inspired by OpenBullet, this repository offers a powerful account checker tailored for Android devices. The application presents an attempt of a user-friendly GUI built with Kivy, powered by a Python backend. Designed for a mobile experience, this tool checks account validity in platforms using custom configs, multi-threading, and proxy support.
